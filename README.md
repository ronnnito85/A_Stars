# A* search algorithm
## An implementation and visualization of the A* Algorithm
This is a Java implementation that represents our final project for the course Programming 51 in Hack Bulgaria.

The algorithm itself is in the PathFinder class and it uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic. The 3 different boards are defined in the Board class.

Legend for the boards:

'#' -> wall

'.' -> free spot

You can create your own boards and check what will happen. Note that the path will always start from the top left and finish at the bottom right cell.
